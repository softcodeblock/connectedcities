Project Title: 

    Find Connected cities, two cities are considered connected if thereâ€™s a series of roads that can be traveled from one city to another and vice versa.

Getting Started:

    These instructions will get you a download/clone the project on your local machine for testing purposes. 

Code Parameters:

1. Complexity 
    While finding connection between cities complexcity is O(1) and while inserting data into map complexity is O(n).

2. Unit Test coverage 
    To test code coverage i used JOCOCO and 96% code is covered.

3. Logging & Exception Handling 
    Basic loging and excetion handing is done. Logs created in current directory e.g. connectingcities/spring-boot-app.log

4. Code cleanliness 
    Code is clean and added comments so that it would be easily understandable. 

5. Spring Boot knowledge 
    I spring boot with java 8 to complete this assignment. 

6. Proper use of a Pattern 
    I try us use some design patterns like dependacy injection. But still this is having scope to use more design patterns.

7. Optimum Directory Structures 
    Directory Structure is optimum. Segrigate different layers.
    
8. Code comments
    Added Code comments so that code would be eaisly understandable.
